    Since I was young, I have been passionate about technology and problem solving. This led me to
    experiment and learn programming on my own, gaining a solid empirical foundation in the field.
    As I grew older, my curiosity and desire to deepen my understanding of computing led me to
    pursue a formal education in the subject.<br /><br />
    I am currently enrolled in the Computer and Systems Engineering degree at the Universidad de Los
    Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia. This institution has not only provided me with a solid theoretical
    framework, but also the opportunity to work on real-world projects and collaborate with
    like-minded peers, further honing my skills.<br /><br />
    My studies cover a variety of topics such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages,
    computer architecture, and software engineering. I am also interested in exploring emerging
    trends such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity.<br /><br />
    In addition, I am actively involved in extracurricular activities, participating in programming
    competitions and industry events to constantly challenge myself and stay ahead of the
    ever-evolving technology landscape.
